# E-commerce Return and Refund Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

An e-commerce company is experiencing a significant increase in product returns, impacting profitability and customer satisfaction. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the returns and refunds data to:

1. Identify patterns, trends, and key drivers behind product returns
2. Quantify the financial impact of returns on different business units
3. Segment customers based on return behaviors
4. Discover product categories with abnormal return rates
5. Evaluate the efficiency of the current return processing workflow
6. Develop actionable recommendations to reduce return rates while maintaining customer satisfaction

Key business questions to address:
- What is causing the high return rate and how can it be reduced?
- Which products, categories, or vendors have disproportionately high return rates?
- Are there specific customer segments driving most returns?
- How do shipping methods, seasonality, and promotions affect return rates?
- What is the true cost of returns (including processing, shipping, restocking)?
- How efficient is the current refund processing timeline?

## Data Sources

This project will require complex SQL queries utilizing:
- Joins across multiple tables
- Window functions for time-based analysis
- CTEs for modular query structure
- Statistical calculations directly in SQL
- Advanced grouping and aggregation
- Cohort analysis techniques


Would you like me to elaborate on specific SQL techniques for any part of this analysis, or provide sample queries for particular aspects of the problem?


You're right - generating synthetic data isn't ideal when you want to demonstrate real-world SQL skills to recruiters. Here are better alternatives for building a return and refund analysis project:

## 1. Use Real E-commerce Datasets with Return Information

- **IBM Retail Data** - Contains sales and return data
  - Available on: https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/retail-sales/
  - Includes transaction-level data with return flags

- **Kaggle's Fashion Retail Dataset**
  - Has customer return behavior for fashion products
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset

## 2. Work with Public Company Data

- **Best Buy Open Data** - As a public company, they publish quarterly data
  - Look for their 10-K and 10-Q reports that include return rate metrics
  - Build SQL queries to analyze trends from their structured data

- **Target or Walmart Financial Reports** - Extract return data from public filings

## 3. Take Part in Industry Competitions

- **Kaggle Competitions** - Occasionally host e-commerce analysis challenges
- **Retail Analytics Council Challenges** - Sometimes feature return analysis problems

## 4. Use Real-world Relational Databases with Sample Data

- **Microsoft's AdventureWorks** - Enterprise database sample with return data
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure
  - Has SalesOrderHeader and SalesReturns tables

- **Oracle Sample Schemas** - Includes retail examples with returns
  - https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas

## 5. Contribute to Open Source Analytics Projects

- Many e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Magento, and WooCommerce have open-source analytics projects where you can contribute return analysis components

## 6. Build SQL Case Studies Based on Public Return Policies

- Analyze and model the return policies of major retailers
- Create SQL schema and analytics based on publicly available return metrics
- Use actual return rate statistics from annual reports

## 7. Partner with Small Businesses

- Local retailers often need help analyzing their returns data
- Offer to build a returns analysis dashboard as a portfolio project
- Can provide real experience with anonymized data

For interviews, having analyzed real data from established sources like AdventureWorks or IBM's retail dataset will be much more impressive than working with synthetic data. These datasets already have the necessary tables and relationships to demonstrate advanced SQL skills.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Realistic Industry Setup**: Using Docker + Python + PostgreSQL is exactly how many data teams work in the real world
2. **Portable Environment**: Docker ensures the database environment is consistent and can be shared
3. **Automation**: Python scripts automate data loading and analysis, showing your programming skills
4. **Portfolio Building**: This becomes a complete end-to-end project you can showcase
5. **Scalable**: You can start with smaller datasets and move to larger ones as you develop your skills

## Working with Interrelated Tables

The beauty of using a proper database system like PostgreSQL is that it handles complex relationships well:

1. **Foreign Keys**: PostgreSQL enforces relationships between tables
2. **Indexing**: Helps with query performance on large datasets
3. **Transactions**: Ensures data integrity when making changes

For AdventureWorks specifically, you need to:
- Follow the correct loading order (parent tables before child tables)
- Preserve primary/foreign key relationships
- Handle data types correctly

This approach will let you practice every SQL feature from basic to advanced, plus add the valuable Python+Docker skills that make you stand out to employers.
